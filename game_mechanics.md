# ⚙️ Game Mechanics

## Turn based

- not entirely but you get to decide your move every n seconds
- 1 turn every n seconds
  - a turn consists of some movement + moves
  - movement carries momentum
- likely 10 secs max since we don't want players to wait too long for every move
- all the system characters / beasts will also make move every turn
